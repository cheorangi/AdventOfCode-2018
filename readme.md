# FIS-AdventOfCode-2018

## Repo for the team to collaborate on the Advent of Code 2018 challenges

## A few house keeping rules
1. Put your code into a Folder with your name or github username so we can tell who's stuff is where.
2. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Hopeful this way we can all see how each of us did it and can help work on them if need be

So lets all have fun and hopefully we all learn a lot

Happy Holidays
