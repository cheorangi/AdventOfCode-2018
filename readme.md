# FIS-AdventOfCode-2018

## Repo for the team to collaborate on the Advent of Code 2018 challenges

## A few house keeping rules
1. Put code for each day into a seperate folder
2. Use the naming convention day1p1-{your name}.py and day1p1-input.txt for the puzzles

Hopeful this way we can all see how each of us did it and can help work on them if need be

So lets all have fun and hopefully we all learn a lot

Happy Holidays
