# FIS-AdventOfCode-2018

## Repo for the team to collaborate on the Advent of Code 2018 challenges

## A few house keeping rules
1. Put code for each day into a seperate folder
2. Use the naming convention day{1-25}p{1-2}-{your name}.py and day{1-25}p{1-2}-{your name}-input.txt for the puzzles
3. If you complete the challenges you can let others know by adding spoiler alert to your commit message so others will no note to review your code if they wish to not know the answers yet
4. Another option for seperating our work would be for each of us to fork the repository and work on it and the commit our changes and merge them together. We can decide the rest on Monday
5. Another way to keep our work seperate would be to use different branches in the same repo

Hopeful this way we can all see how each of us did it and can help work on them if need be

So lets all have fun and hopefully we all learn a lot

Happy Holidays
